# 🧯 Industrial Safety Object Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains our solution for the BuildWithIndia 2.0 Hackathon organized by SunHacks, where we trained a YOLOv8 model to detect **Fire Extinguishers**, **Tool Boxes**, and **Oxygen Tanks** in industrial environments using computer vision.
