# 🧯 Industrial Safety Object Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains our solution for the BuildWithIndia 2.0 Hackathon organized by SunHacks, where we trained a YOLOv8 model to detect **Fire Extinguishers**, **Tool Boxes**, and **Oxygen Tanks** in industrial environments using computer vision.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to ensure workplace safety using real-time object detection of essential equipment. By leveraging YOLOv8 and ONNX, our solution can run across various platforms — and is optimized for Flutter (mobile) integration.

### 📌 Objects Detected:
- 🔥 Fire Extinguisher
- 🧰 Tool Box
- 🧪 Oxygen Tank

## 📊 Final Results

After training and evaluation, the model achieved:

| Class            | Precision | Recall | mAP@0.5 | mAP@0.5:0.95 |
|------------------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| Fire Extinguisher| **1.000** | 0.936  | **0.977** | 0.914 |
| Tool Box         | 0.992     | 0.883  | **0.948** | 0.916 |
| Oxygen Tank      | 0.965     | 0.873  | **0.901** | 0.822 |
| **Overall**      | 0.986     | 0.898  | **0.942** | **0.884** |
